When people contact us with complex health concerns, we often first suggest they consider contacting doctors at a larger university or academic health center.

En tales casos, puede conocerse poca información sobre la enfermedad, y las secciones en el sitio web de GARD pueden estar ausentes o incompletas.\n\nCuando hay información limitada disponible, GARD aún puede brindarle ayuda. Cuando las personas nos contactan con preocupaciones de salud complejas, a menudo sugerimos que consideren contactar a médicos en una universidad grande o en un centro académico de salud.
