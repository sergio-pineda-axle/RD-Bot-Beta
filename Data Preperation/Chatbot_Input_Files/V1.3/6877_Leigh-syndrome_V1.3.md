## [Section 1: Disease Information]
### [Summary]
Leigh syndrome is a rare, inherited neurodegenerative condition. It usually becomes apparent in infancy, often after a viral infection. Signs and symptoms usually progress rapidly. Early symptoms may include poor sucking ability; loss of head control and motor skills; loss of appetite; vomiting; and seizures. As the condition progresses, symptoms may include weakness and lack of muscle tone; spasticity; movement disorders; cerebellar ataxia; and peripheral neuropathy. Complications can lead to impairment of respiratory, heart and kidney function. The term "Leigh-like syndrome" is often used for people with features that are strongly suggestive of Leigh syndrome but who do not meet the diagnostic criteria. The inheritance of Leigh syndrome depends on where the responsible gene is located in each case. This is because it can be due to genetic changes in either mitochondrial DNA or nuclear DNA: Mitochondrial DNA-associated Leigh syndrome follows a mitochondrial inheritance pattern (also called maternal inheritance). Nuclear gene-encoded Leigh syndrome may be inherited in an autosomal recessive or X-linked manner.

## [Section 2: Causes] 

### [What Causes This Disease?]

#### Genetic Mutations
Leigh syndrome is caused by genetic mutations, also known as pathogenic variants. Genetic mutations can be hereditary, when parents pass them down to their children, or they may occur randomly when cells are dividing. Genetic mutations may also result from contracted viruses, environmental factors, such as UV radiation from sunlight exposure, or a combination of any of these.

#### Disruption in Metabolism 
Leigh syndrome is caused by a disruption in a person's metabolism. Metabolism is the series of chemical reactions in our body that turns the food we eat into energy and removes toxins. Hormones and specific proteins, called enzymes, help make the right chemical reactions happen in the right order. However, genetic changes can prevent hormones or enzymes from working properly, which can lead to a disruption in metabolism such as energy not being created for the body or toxins not being removed from the body.

![Illustration titled 'Impaired Metabolism' showing a human silhouette labeled with a process of metabolic dysfunction. Food intake (depicted by bananas and apples) leads to a metabolic genetic mutation, illustrated with a DNA strand, causing toxins to build up in the body and resulting in low energy (represented by a depleted battery icon).](https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/assets/images/0693d00000BgWIzAAN-400.webp)

#### Impaired Mitochondrial Function: 
Leigh syndrome is caused by an impairment, or issue, in mitochondrial function. Mitochondria make the energy needed for cells to work properly. When mitochondria are unable to produce enough energy for a cell, the cell can become damaged or can die. Depending on the location and number of damaged cells, different organs and body systems can be affected. [Learn more about mitochondrial diseases from the National Library of Medicine (NLM)](https://medlineplus.gov/mitochondrialdiseases.html).

On the right, an impaired mitochondrion is depicted with a red, nearly empty battery icon, signifying reduced energy production.](https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/assets/images/0693d00000BXVKnAAP-400.webp)

### [Inheritance] 
Can This Disease Be Passed Down From Parent to Child?

Yes. It is possible for a biological parent to pass down genetic mutations that cause or increase the chances of getting this disease to their child. This is known as inheritance. Knowing whether other family members have previously had this disease, also known as family health history, can be very important information for your medical team. [This tool from the Surgeon General can help you collect your family health history](https://www.cdc.gov/family-health-history/about/index.html).

There are multiple ways, or patterns, a disease can be inherited depending on the gene(s) involved. Based on GARD's current data, this disease can be inherited in the following pattern(s):

#### Mitochondrial Inheritance: 
Mitochondrial inheritance means the genetic mutation is located in a specific type of DNA, called mtDNA. mtDNA is found within the cell's mitochondria. Mitochondria are tiny structures that produce energy for the body. Genetic mutations within mtDNA can prevent the mitochondria from working properly.

During human conception, egg cells, or the cells that come from the female parent, provide mitochondria. If a female parent is affected by a mitochondrial genetic mutation, there is a 100% chance their child inherits the mutated gene. However, the child may or may not be affected by the disease. A male parent cannot pass mitochondrial genetic mutations to their children.

[Learn more about inheritance patterns from the National Library of Medicine (NLM)](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/inheritance/inheritancepatterns/).

![Illustration titled 'Mitochondrial' showing inheritance patterns from parents to children. The diagram highlights that mitochondrial DNA is only inherited from the mother. On the top row, it shows a father unaffected and mother affected scenario versus father affected and mother unaffected. The bottom row shows affected and unaffected children depending on whether the mother carries the mutation. The only affected children are those on the left who inherited the mutation from the affected mother.](https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/assets/images/0693d00000BiNwaAAF-400.webp)

#### Autosomal Recessive Inheritance:
Autosomal means the gene involved is located on one of the numbered chromosomes. Recessive means that a child must inherit two copies of the mutated gene, one from each biological parent, to be affected by the disease. A carrier is a person who only has one copy of the genetic mutation. A carrier usually doesn't show any symptoms of the disease.

If both biological parents are carriers, there is a 25% their child inherits both copies of the mutated gene and is affected by the disease. Additionally, there is a 50% chance their child inherits only one copy of the mutated gene and is a carrier.

[Learn more about inheritance patterns from the National Library of Medicine (NLM)](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/inheritance/inheritancepatterns/).

![Illustration titled 'Autosomal Recessive' showing inheritance patterns. The top row displays parents who are both carriers of a mutation. The bottom row illustrates the potential outcomes for children: one affected, two carriers, and one unaffected, based on the inheritance of mutated and normal genes. Chromosomes are included to depict the genetic mutation visually.](https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/assets/images/0693d00000BiOqNAAV-400.webp)

#### X-Linked Inheritance
X-linked inheritance means the genetic mutation is located on the X chromosome, one of the sex chromosomes. The male sex chromosome pair consists of one X and one Y chromosome (XY). The female sex chromosome pair consists of two X chromosomes (XX). Because males have just one X chromosome, it takes only one copy of the mutated gene to cause the disease. Females that have one copy of the mutated gene may have symptoms similar to those experienced by affected males, but usually have less severe symptoms, or no symptoms at all.

Female parents with one X-linked mutated gene have a 50% chance of passing on the mutation to each of their biological children. Male parents with an X-linked mutated gene will pass on the mutation to all their female children but cannot pass the mutation on to their male children.

![Illustration titled 'X-Linked Inheritance' showing genetic inheritance from a mother (XX) and father (XY) to daughters and sons. It highlights how X-linked traits are passed, with daughters inheriting an X chromosome from each parent and sons inheriting an X chromosome from their mother and a Y chromosome from their father. The diagram uses solid and dashed lines to indicate inheritance paths.](https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/assets/images/0693d00000AoYlYAAV-400.webp)

### [Body System Category(-ies) Defintions]
Symptoms related to Leigh syndrome may affect different systems of the body. 
(Here are the descriptions of the Body Systems Category(-ies) values referenced in the symptoms above)

#### Blood and Blood-Forming Tissue
The blood and blood-forming tissue includes plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and bone marrow. Common symptoms of problems with the blood or blood forming tissue include fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, fever, abnormal bleeding, headache, or bruising easily. Diseases of the blood may be diagnosed and treated by a hematologist.

#### Cardiovascular System
The cardiovascular system is made up of the heart and blood vessels, including the arteries, veins, and capillaries. Common symptoms of problems in the cardiovascular system include high blood pressure, heart rate or heart rhythm problems, chest pain or discomfort, pain or tingling in the hands or feet, and fatigue. Diseases of the cardiovascular system may be diagnosed and treated by a cardiologist.

#### Digestive System
The digestive system is made up of the esophagus, stomach, intestines, liver, pancreas, and gallbladder. Common symptoms of problems in the digestive system include blood in the stool, changes in bowel habits, severe abdominal pain, unintentional weight loss, or heartburn. Diseases affecting the digestive system may be diagnosed and treated by a gastroenterologist (GI specialist).

#### Immune System
The immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that together help the body fight infections and other diseases. This system is made up of the skin, mucous membranes, white blood cells, and organs and tissues of the lymph system, including the thymus, spleen, tonsils, lymph nodes, lymph vessels and bone marrow. Common symptoms of problems in the immune system include fatigue, joint pain, skin rash, abdominal pain or digestive issues, fever, swollen glands, repeated infections, or headaches. Diseases of the immune system may be diagnosed and treated by an allergist, immunologist, or rheumatologist.

#### Musculoskeletal System
The musculoskeletal system is made up of the bones, muscles, and joints. Common symptoms of problems in the musculoskeletal system include pain, weakness, stiffness, noises in the joints, inflammation, and decreased range of motion. Diseases affecting the musculoskeletal system may be diagnosed and treated by an orthopedist, rheumatologist, or neuromuscular specialist.

#### Nervous System 
The nervous system is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. Common symptoms of problems in the nervous system include trouble moving, speaking, swallowing, breathing, or learning. Problems with memory, senses, or mood may also occur. Nervous system diseases are usually diagnosed and treated by neurologists.

#### Respiratory System
The respiratory system is made up of the lungs and the nose, mouth, throat, voice box, windpipe, diaphragm, and muscles of the chest wall. This system controls breathing, providing the body with oxygen and getting rid of carbon dioxide. Common symptoms of problems in the respiratory system include chronic cough, shortness of breath, chronic chest pain, coughing up blood, and chronic mucus production. Diseases of the respiratory system may be diagnosed and treated by a pulmonologist.

#### Skin System
The skin or integumentary system is made up of skin, hair, nails, sweat glands, and oil glands. Common symptoms of problems in the skin system include redness, swelling, burning, itching, rashes, and hives. Skin diseases are often diagnosed and treated by dermatologists. Other specialists may also be involved including rheumatologists, allergists, and infectious disease doctors.

## [Section 4: Diagnostic Journey]
On average, it takes more than six years to receive an accurate rare disease diagnosis. Many primary care providers (PCPs) may not be familiar with rare diseases, and you may need to see multiple specialists to reach the correct diagnosis. However, advocating for yourself with your healthcare team may help speed your time to diagnosis. To combat common challenges, be prepared:
1. Find disease-specific information to discuss with your healthcare providers.
2. Ask for diagnostic tests.
3. Request referrals to specialists.
Knowing where to start your diagnostic journey and how to navigate the next steps are critical to speeding your time to diagnosis.

### Your Diagnostic Team
#### How can a diagnostic team help?
Establishing care with a dedicated primary care provider (PCP) is an important early step in your rare disease journey. A PCP can help improve care and shorten the time to diagnosis by providing referrals to the appropriate specialists. These specialists, with advanced training in different body systems or types of diseases, can offer the specialized diagnostic procedures you need.

[Use this tool by medicare to find a PCP in your area](https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare/?providerType=Physician) by inputting your location and keyword "Primary Care Provider".

A PCP that specializes in the care of children is called a pediatrician. [Use this tool by the American Academy of Pediatrics to find a pediatrician in your area](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/tips-tools/find-pediatrician/Pages/Pediatrician-Referral-Service.aspx) by inputting your location.

#### [Diagnostic teams for Leigh syndrome may include:]

##### Genetics 
Genetic specialists focus on diagnosing, treating, and managing patients with genetic changes that affect a person’s health. Specialists known as genetic counselors and geneticists commonly interview patients about family history and discuss genetic risks to diagnose genetic conditions. They may also use genetic testing to determine a diagnosis. Genetic counselors often specialize in certain types of genetic diseases like cancer, or different life stages like prenatal or pediatric genetic counseling.
[You may be able to find a genetic specialist in your area through the directory by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics](https://clinics.acmg.net/).

##### Neurology
Neurology specialists focus on diagnosing, treating, and managing diseases that affect the nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. Neurologists often use imaging studies, physical examination, or cognitive assessments to diagnose neurological diseases.
[You may be able to find a neurologist in your area by inputting your location and keyword "Neurology" through this directory by Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare/?providerType=Physician).

##### Ophthalmology
Ophthalmology specialists focus on diagnosing, treating, and managing diseases that affect the eyes. Ophthalmologists may perform examinations and order tests or imaging studies to aid in diagnosis.
[You may be able to find an ophthalmologist in your area through the directory by the American Academy of Ophthalmology](https://secure.aao.org/aao/find-ophthalmologist).

### [Multidisciplinary Care Centers]
Is it time to find a multidisciplinary care center?: If you've visited your PCP, met with specialists, and undergone the recommended tests, but still do not have a confirmed diagnosis, it may be time to visit a multidisciplinary care center. 

Multidisciplinary care centers are usually teaching, university, or research hospitals that have teams of medical experts and specialists working together in the same location. This means a wide range of diagnostic tests and clinical knowledge are available at one facility, which can help increase communication and collaboration among your care team. The additional resources often available at multidisciplinary centers may help speed the time to diagnosis for rare diseases.

[Use this tool to find hospitals that may partner with medical schools and programs in your area.](https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare/?providerType=Hospital).

Some multidisciplinary care centers focus on the care and treatment of children. [Use this tool  to find children's multidisciplinary care centers by searching for university or research hospitals in your area](https://www.childrenshospitals.org/hospital-directory#sort=%40z95xdisplayname%20ascending).

### [Rare Disease Experts]

#### How can you find a rare disease expert?
If a diagnosis remains unknown despite extensive efforts by your PCP and specialists, it can be challenging to know what kind of expert you may need or where to find one. A rare disease expert is a care provider that has knowledge or training on specific disease(s), but there may only be a few experts in your state, region, or country. Rare disease experts may work at large research or teaching hospitals. In complex cases, coordinating with a network of experts can help your care provider find the right diagnosis. 
[Contact a GARD Information Specialist for help finding an expert](https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/contact).

You can ask your care providers for help finding an expert or use directory tools to search for experts near you. The following organization(s) may maintain a list of experts or expert centers for people living with Leigh syndrome:
* [Muscular Dystrophy Association](https://www.mda.org/care/mda-care-centers)
* [MitoAction](https://www.mitoaction.org/doctors/)
* [United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation](https://www.umdf.org/find-a-doctor/)

## [Section 5: Find Your Community]
### How Can Patient Organizations Help?
Patient organizations can help patients and families connect. They build public awareness of the disease and are a driving force behind research to improve patients' lives. They may offer online and in-person resources to help people live well with their disease. Many collaborate with medical experts and researchers.

Services of patient organizations differ, but may include:
* Ways to connect to others and share personal stories
* Easy-to-read information
* Up-to-date treatment and research information
* Patient registries
* Lists of specialists or specialty centers
* Financial aid and travel resources

## [Section 6: Participate in Research]
Clinical studies are part of clinical research and play an important role in medical advances, including for rare diseases. Through clinical studies, researchers may ultimately uncover better ways to treat, prevent, diagnose, and understand human diseases.

### What Are Clinical Studies?
Clinical studies are medical research involving people as participants. There are two main types of clinical studies:
1. Clinical trials determine if a new test or treatment for a disease is effective and safe by comparing groups receiving different tests/treatments.
2. Observational studies involve recording changes over time among a specific group of people in their natural settings.
[Learn more about clinical trials from this U.S. Food & Drug Administration webpage](https://www.fda.gov/patients/clinical-trials-what-patients-need-know)

### Why Participate in Clinical Studies?
People participate in clinical trials for many reasons. People with a disease may participate to receive the newest possible treatment and additional care from clinical study staff as well as to help others living with the same or similar disease. Healthy volunteers may participate to help others and to contribute to moving science forward.

To find the right clinical study we recommend you consult your doctors, other trusted medical professionals, and patient organizations. Additionally, you can use ClinicalTrials.gov to search for clinical studies by disease, terms, or location.

### What if There Are No Available Clinical Studies?
[ResearchMatch helps connect people interested in research studies](https://www.researchmatch.org/) with researchers from top medical centers across the United States. Anyone from the U.S. can register with this free program funded by NIH. Researchers from participating institutions use the database to search for and invite patients or healthy volunteers who meet their study criteria to participate.

### Join the All of Us Research Program!
The [All of Us Research Program is inviting 1 million people from all backgrounds across the U.S. to help build one of the most diverse health databases in history](https://allofus.nih.gov/). Researchers will use the data to learn how our biology, lifestyle, and environment affect health. This may one day help them find ways to treat and prevent diseases.

### ClinicalTrials.gov
ClinicalTrials.gov, an affiliate of NIH, provides current information on clinical research studies in the United States and abroad. Talk to a trusted doctor before choosing to participate in any clinical study. We recommend checking this site often and searching for studies with related terms/synonyms to improve results.
