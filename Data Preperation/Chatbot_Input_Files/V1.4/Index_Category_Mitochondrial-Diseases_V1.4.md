# Mitochondrial Diseases

## Definition
Mitochondrial diseases are a group of genetic diseases that affect the ability of the body's cells to make energy.

## Cause & Pathophysiology: Impaired Mitochondrial Function

Mitochondrial diseases are caused by an impairment, or issue, in mitochondrial function. Mitochondria make the energy needed for cells to work properly. When mitochondria are unable to produce enough energy for a cell, the cell can become damaged or can die. Depending on the location and number of damaged cells, different organs and body systems can be affected.

On the right, an impaired mitochondrion is depicted with a red, nearly empty battery icon, signifying reduced energy production.](https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/assets/images/0693d00000BXVKnAAP-400.webp)
