# Inherited Metabolic Diseases

## Nomenclature
Disease Category Name: Inherited Metabolic Diseases
Synonyms: Inborn Errors of Metabolism;  Metabolic Diseases

## Definition
Inherited metabolic diseases, or inborn errors of metabolism, are a group of genetic diseases that affect the ability of the body's cells to convert food into energy. 

## Cause & Pathophysiology: Disruption in Metabolism 

Inherited metabolic diseases are caused by a disruption in a person's metabolism. Metabolism is the series of chemical reactions in our body that turns the food we eat into energy and removes toxins. Hormones and specific proteins, called enzymes, help make the right chemical reactions happen in the right order. However, genetic changes can prevent hormones or enzymes from working properly, which can lead to a disruption in metabolism such as energy not being created for the body or toxins not being removed from the body.
