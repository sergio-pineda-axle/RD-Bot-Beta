# Disease: [Leigh Syndrome](https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6877/leigh-syndrome)

## Nomenclature
Disease Name: Leigh syndrome
Other Names: infantile necrotizing encephalomyelopathy; infantile subacute necrotizing encephalopathy; juvenile subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy; Leigh disease; Leigh syndrome spectrum; Leigh's disease; LS; LSS

## Disease Summary
Leigh syndrome is a rare, inherited neurodegenerative condition. It usually becomes apparent in infancy, often after a viral infection. Signs and symptoms usually progress rapidly. Early symptoms may include poor sucking ability; loss of head control and motor skills; loss of appetite; vomiting; and seizures. As the condition progresses, symptoms may include weakness and lack of muscle tone; spasticity; movement disorders; cerebellar ataxia; and peripheral neuropathy. Complications can lead to impairment of respiratory, heart and kidney function. The term "Leigh-like syndrome" is often used for people with features that are strongly suggestive of Leigh syndrome but who do not meet the diagnostic criteria. The inheritance of Leigh syndrome depends on where the responsible gene is located in each case. This is because it can be due to genetic changes in either mitochondrial DNA or nuclear DNA: Mitochondrial DNA-associated Leigh syndrome follows a mitochondrial inheritance pattern (also called maternal inheritance). Nuclear gene-encoded Leigh syndrome may be inherited in an autosomal recessive or X-linked manner.

## Leigh syndrome Population Estimate:
* Population Estimate: Fewer than 50,000 people in the U.S. have this disease.

## Leigh syndrome Disease Categories:
* Inherited Metabolic disease: Inherited metabolic diseases, or inborn errors of metabolism, are a group of genetic diseases that affect the ability of the body's cells to convert food into energy. 
* Mitochondrial disease: Mitochondrial diseases are a group of genetic diseases that affect the ability of the body's cells to make energy.
* Genetic disease: Genetic diseases affect the DNA, or genetic instructions, which directs how tissues, organs, and body systems function
* Neurological disease: Neurological diseases affect the brain, spinal cord, cranial nerves, autonomic nerves, or other peripheral nerves. 

## Leigh Syndrome Age at Onset
When Do Symptoms of Leigh syndrome Begin?: Symptoms of Leigh syndrome may start to appear at any time in life. This includes:
* Prenatal: Before Brith
* Newborn: Birth-4weeks
* Infant: 1-23 months
* Child: 2-11 years
* Adolescent: 12-18 years
* Adult: 19-65 years
* Older Adult: 65+ years

The age symptoms may begin to appear differs between patients. Knowing when symptoms may have appeared can help medical providers find the correct diagnosis.

## Leigh syndrome Symptoms

## Leigh Syndrome Causes

### Genetic Mutations
Leigh syndrome is caused by genetic mutations, also known as pathogenic variants. Genetic mutations can be hereditary, when parents pass them down to their children, or they may occur randomly when cells are dividing. Genetic mutations may also result from contracted viruses, environmental factors, such as UV radiation from sunlight exposure, or a combination of any of these.

### Disruption in Metabolism 
Leigh syndrome is caused by a disruption in a person's metabolism. Metabolism is the series of chemical reactions in our body that turns the food we eat into energy and removes toxins. Hormones and specific proteins, called enzymes, help make the right chemical reactions happen in the right order. However, genetic changes can prevent hormones or enzymes from working properly, which can lead to a disruption in metabolism such as energy not being created for the body or toxins not being removed from the body.

![Illustration titled 'Impaired Metabolism' showing a human silhouette labeled with a process of metabolic dysfunction.

### Impaired Mitochondrial Function: 
Leigh syndrome is caused by an impairment, or issue, in mitochondrial function. Mitochondria make the energy needed for cells to work properly. When mitochondria are unable to produce enough energy for a cell, the cell can become damaged or can die. Depending on the location and number of damaged cells, different organs and body systems can be affected. [Learn more about mitochondrial diseases from the National Library of Medicine (NLM)](https://medlineplus.gov/mitochondrialdiseases.html).

On the right, an impaired mitochondrion is depicted with a red, nearly empty battery icon, signifying reduced energy production.](https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/assets/images/0693d00000BXVKnAAP-400.webp)

## Leigh Syndrome Inheritance 
Can Leigh Syndrome Be Passed Down From Parent to Child?
	Yes. It is possible for a biological parent to pass down genetic mutations that cause or increase the chances of getting this disease to their child. This is known as inheritance. Knowing whether other family members have previously had this disease, also known as family health history, can be very important information for your medical team. [This tool from the Surgeon General can help you collect your family health history](https://www.cdc.gov/family-health-history/about/index.html).

There are multiple ways, or patterns, a disease can be inherited depending on the gene(s) involved. Based on GARD's current data, Leigh syndrome can be inherited in the following pattern(s):

### Mitochondrial Inheritance
Mitochondrial inheritance means the genetic mutation is located in a specific type of DNA, called mtDNA. mtDNA is found within the cell's mitochondria. Mitochondria are tiny structures that produce energy for the body. Genetic mutations within mtDNA can prevent the mitochondria from working properly.

During human conception, egg cells, or the cells that come from the female parent, provide mitochondria. If a female parent is affected by a mitochondrial genetic mutation, there is a 100% chance their child inherits the mutated gene. However, the child may or may not be affected by the disease. A male parent cannot pass mitochondrial genetic mutations to their children.

[Learn more about inheritance patterns from the National Library of Medicine (NLM)](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/inheritance/inheritancepatterns/).

![Illustration titled 'Mitochondrial' showing inheritance patterns from parents to children. The diagram highlights that mitochondrial DNA is only inherited from the mother. On the top row, it shows a father unaffected and mother affected scenario versus father affected and mother unaffected. The bottom row shows affected and unaffected children depending on whether the mother carries the mutation. The only affected children are those on the left who inherited the mutation from the affected mother.](https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/assets/images/0693d00000BiNwaAAF-400.webp)

### Autosomal Recessive Inheritance
Autosomal means the gene involved is located on one of the numbered chromosomes. Recessive means that a child must inherit two copies of the mutated gene, one from each biological parent, to be affected by the disease. A carrier is a person who only has one copy of the genetic mutation. A carrier usually doesn't show any symptoms of the disease.

If both biological parents are carriers, there is a 25% their child inherits both copies of the mutated gene and is affected by the disease. Additionally, there is a 50% chance their child inherits only one copy of the mutated gene and is a carrier.

![Illustration titled 'Autosomal Recessive' showing inheritance patterns. The top row displays parents who are both carriers of a mutation. The bottom row illustrates the potential outcomes for children: one affected, two carriers, and one unaffected, based on the inheritance of mutated and normal genes. Chromosomes are included to depict the genetic mutation visually.](https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/assets/images/0693d00000BiOqNAAV-400.webp)

### X-Linked Inheritance
X-linked inheritance means the genetic mutation is located on the X chromosome, one of the sex chromosomes. The male sex chromosome pair consists of one X and one Y chromosome (XY). The female sex chromosome pair consists of two X chromosomes (XX). Because males have just one X chromosome, it takes only one copy of the mutated gene to cause the disease. Females that have one copy of the mutated gene may have symptoms similar to those experienced by affected males, but usually have less severe symptoms, or no symptoms at all.

Female parents with one X-linked mutated gene have a 50% chance of passing on the mutation to each of their biological children. Male parents with an X-linked mutated gene will pass on the mutation to all their female children but cannot pass the mutation on to their male children.

![Illustration titled 'X-Linked Inheritance' showing genetic inheritance from a mother (XX) and father (XY) to daughters and sons. It highlights how X-linked traits are passed, with daughters inheriting an X chromosome from each parent and sons inheriting an X chromosome from their mother and a Y chromosome from their father. The diagram uses solid and dashed lines to indicate inheritance paths.](https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/assets/images/0693d00000AoYlYAAV-400.webp)

## Leigh syndrome diagnostic team

### Primary Care Provider or Pediatrician
Primary care providers (PCPs) and pediatricians are doctors who focus on overall health, preventive care, and the treatment of common illnesses. PCPs care for patients of all ages, while pediatricians specialize in caring for infants, children, and teenagers. They perform regular check-ups, diagnose and manage a wide range of medical conditions, and provide vaccinations to help prevent disease. These doctors also guide families on nutrition, growth, and development, and refer patients to specialists when needed. Pediatricians often work closely with parents to support children's physical and emotional well-being from infancy through adolescence.
