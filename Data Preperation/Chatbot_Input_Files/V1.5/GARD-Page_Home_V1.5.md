## Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center
Did you know there are over 10,000 rare diseases? In fact, rare diseases are estimated to affect more than 30 million people in the United States. Each disease may be rare individually, but people with rare diseases often face similar challenges. These challenges may include accessing information, getting a diagnosis, and finding resources.

The mission of the Genetic and Rare Diseases (GARD) Information Center is to help the rare disease community meet these common challenges. We do this by providing free access to reliable and easy-to-understand information. We support the rare disease community both through our website and through the dedicated Information Specialists in our Contact Center.
