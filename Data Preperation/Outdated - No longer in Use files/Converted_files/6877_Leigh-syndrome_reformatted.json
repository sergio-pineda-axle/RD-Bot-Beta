        "Description": "Leigh syndrome can be caused by genetic changes in any of more than 75 different genes. Most of our genes are made up of DNA in the cell's nucleus (nuclear DNA). Some of our genes are made up of DNA in other cell structures called mitochondria (mitochondrial DNA, or mtDNA). Most people with Leigh syndrome have a genetic change in nuclear DNA, and about 20% have a genetic change in mtDNA.\n\nMost genes associated with Leigh syndrome are involved in the process of energy production in mitochondria (oxidative phosphorylation). Five protein complexes, named complex I through complex IV, are involved in this process. Many of the genetic changes associated with Leigh syndrome disrupt the function of proteins in these complexes, how the complexes form, or additional steps related to energy production. Researchers believe that impaired oxidative phosphorylation may cause cells to die because they don't have enough energy. The death of brain cells likely contributes to the neurologic features of the condition, while the death of cells in other tissues may lead to additional symptoms in other parts of the body.\n\nMore information about the genes responsible for Leigh syndrome is available here on the Genetics Home Reference website.",
